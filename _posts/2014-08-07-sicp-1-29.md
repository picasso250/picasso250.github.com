>Exercise 1.29.  Simpson's Rule is a more accurate method of numerical integration than the method illustrated above. Using Simpson's Rule, the integral of a function f between a and b is approximated as

> <span class="math">
\\(
\frac{h}{3}[y_0+4y_1+2y_2+4y_3+2y_4+...2y_n-2 + 4y_n-1 + y_n]
\\)
</span>

> where h = (b - a)/n, for some even integer n, and yk = f(a + kh). (Increasing n increases the accuracy of the approximation.) Define a procedure that takes as arguments f, a, b, and n and returns the value of the integral, computed using Simpson's Rule. Use your procedure to integrate cube between 0 and 1 (with n = 100 and n = 1000), and compare the results to those of the integral procedure shown above.

中间的那个列表可以拆成三个列表

<span class="math">
\\(
y_0+y_1+y_2+...+y_n-1 +y_n
\\)
</span>

<span class="math">
\\(
y_1+y_2+y_3...+y_n-2 +y_n-1
\\)
</span>

<span class="math">
\\(
2y_1+2y_3+2y_5...+2y_n-3 +2y_n-1
\\)
</span>

于是，我们可以写出程序

```
(define (integral f a b n)
  (define h (/ (- b a) n))
  (define (f-next x) (+ x h))
  (define (f-next-2 x) (+ x h h))
  (/ (* h
    (+ (sum f (+ a h) f-next (- b h))
       (sum f a f-next b)
       (* 2 (sum f (+ a h) f-next-2 (- b h)))))
     3.0))
```
