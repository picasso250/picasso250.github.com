Exercise 1.41.  Define a procedure double that takes a procedure of one argument as argument and returns a procedure that applies the original procedure twice. For example, if inc is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument, then (double inc) should be a procedure that adds 2. What value is returned by

```
(((double (double double)) inc) 5)
```

It is simple to write `double` down.

```
(define (double f)
  (lambda (x) (f (f x))))
```

or

```
(define double
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x) (f (f x)))))
```

than the question is: how to evalute the final result with only your head permitted?

---

let R0 = `(((double (double double)) inc) 5)`, which is the final result.

let F4 = (double double).

let F16 = (double F4).

then
F16 = (lambda (x) (F4 (F4 x)))

then
(F16 inc) = (F4 (F4 inc))

as we know
(F4 f) = ((double double) f)
= ((lambda (x) (double (double x))) f)
= (double (double f))

so
(F4 inc) = (double (double inc))

let F4-inc = (F4 inc)

then (F4 F4-inc) = (double (double F4-inc)) = (double (double (double (double inc))))

let F2-inc' = (double inc)

then
F2-inc' = (lambda (x) (inc (inc x)))

let F4-inc' = (double F2-inc') = (lambda (x) (F2-inc' (F2-inc' x)))

let F8-inc' = (double F4-inc') = (lambda (x) (F4-inc' (F4-inc' x)))

let F16-inc' = (double F8-inc') = (lambda (x) (F8-inc' (F8-inc' x)))

F16-inc' = (double (double (double (double inc)))) = (F4 (F4 inc)) = (F16 inc) = ((dboule F4) inc) = ((double (double double)) inc)

R0 
= (F16-inc' 5) 
= (F8-inc' (F8-inc' 5)) 
= (F8-inc' (F4-inc' (F4-inc' 5))) 
= (F8-inc' (F4-inc' (F2-inc' (F2-inc' 5)))) 
= (F8-inc' (F4-inc' (F2-inc' (inc (inc 5))))) 
= (F8-inc' (F4-inc' (F2-inc' (inc 6)))) 
= (F8-inc' (F4-inc' (F2-inc' 7))) 
= (F8-inc' (F4-inc' (inc (inc 7)))) 
= (F8-inc' (F4-inc' 9)) 
= (F8-inc' (F2-inc' (F2-inc' 9))) 
= (F8-inc' (F2-inc' (inc (inc 9)))) 
= (F8-inc' (F2-inc' 11))
= (F8-inc' (inc (inc 11)))
= (F8-inc' 13)
= (F4-inc' (F4-inc' 13))
= (F4-inc' (F2-inc' (F2-inc' 13)))
= (F4-inc' (F2-inc' (inc (inc 13))))
= (F4-inc' (F2-inc' 15))
= (F4-inc' (inc (inc 15)))
= (F4-inc' 17)
= (F2-inc' (F2-inc' 17)))
= (F2-inc' (inc (inc 17)))
= (F2-inc' 19)
= (inc (inc 19))
= 21
